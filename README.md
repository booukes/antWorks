## About The Project

This is a custom-built developer portfolio created from the ground up to serve as a professional showcase of my work. The primary focus was on creating a fast, responsive, and visually appealing user experience. Here you will find an introduction to my skill set, a detailed look at my projects, and a functional contact form to get in touch.

## Built With

This project was built using the following modern technologies:

- **SvelteKit**: For a high-performance, compiler-based approach to web development.
- **TypeScript**: For robust, scalable, and maintainable code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent UI development.
- **Vite**: For an extremely fast development server and build tool.
- **Nodemailer**: For handling the server-side logic of the contact form.

## Key Features

- **‚ú® Engaging UI/UX**: Smooth page transitions and animations to create a fluid user experience.
- **üñºÔ∏è 3D Parallax Effect**: An interactive 3D tilt effect on the "About Me" card that responds to mouse movement.
- **üìÇ Interactive Project Showcase**: An expandable section for projects, allowing users to view details without leaving the page.
- **üìß Functional Contact Form**: A working contact form for easy communication.
- **üì± Fully Responsive**: Designed to look and work great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
